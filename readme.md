## Abstract

Write a brief abstract about your research project.
If the project is a reproduction or replication study, include the full citation with a statement
This study is a *reproduction/replication* of:

> Kimambo, Niwaeli. 2021. *Lec/Lab: Gerrymandering: Maps and political representation* Human Geography with GIS (GEOG 120) at Middlebury College.

The original lab aims to determine whether North Carolina's 2019 congressional districts, which were redrawn by court order, are fairer than the 2016 districts based on geographic compactness and political representation.
First, votes cast in the 2016 presidential election are used to estimate the percentage of Republican voters in the 2016 and 2019 congressional districts.
Then, compactness scores are calculated by multiplying the area by 400Ï€ and dividing by the perimeter squared.
The devliverables include summary statistics for the compactness and percentage of Republicans from the 2026 and 2019 districts, as well as 4 maps: 
percentage votes for Republican presidential candidate by voting precinct, percentage votes for the 2016 Republican presidential candidate by 2016 districts, percentage of votes for the 2016 Republican presidential candidate by 2019 districts, and the compactness scores for each 2016 and 2019 district.

## Compendium structure and contents

This research compendium is structured with four main directories:

- `data`: contains subdirectories for `raw` data and `derived` data.
- `docs`: contains subdirectories for `manuscript`, `presentation`, and `report`
- `procedure`: contains subdirectories for `code` or software scripts, information about the computational `environment` in which the research was conducted, and non-code research `protocols`
- `results`: contains subdirectories for `figures`, formatted data `tables`, or `other` formats of research results.

The data, procedures, and results of this repository are outlined in three tables:
- Data: [data/data_index.csv](data/data_index.csv)
- Procedures: [procedure/procedure_index.csv](procedure/procedure_index.csv)
